- Agiltity: Rapidly develop, test and launch software

### Problems with traditional IT:
- Pay for rent for the data centre
- Pay for power, cooling and maintenance 
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time
- Scaling is limited
- Needs a team to monitor 24/7
- No disaster recovery

### Types of Cloud Computing:

**frastrcture as a Service:
